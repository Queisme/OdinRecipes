    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p></p>

    <ul><h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <li><strong>Oil</strong>: 2 Tbsp of Olive oil or a neutral-flavored canola or vegetable oil will work</li>
        <li><strong>Mirepoix</strong>: A base of celery, carrots, and onion.<ul><li>2 carrots, peeled and diced</li><li>3 stalks celery, diced</li><li>1 small white onion, diced</li></ul></li>
        <li><strong>Potatoes</strong>: 2 medium potatoes, peeled and diced (roughly 3 ½ cups)</li>
        <li><strong>Cooked Ham</strong>: 2 cups cooked diced ham. Ham Steak or baked ham work. If you want, you can leave the Ham out and make this a vegetable chowder.</li>
        <li><strong>Vegetable Broth</strong>: 6 cups or 2 Tbsp of vegetable bouillon in 6 cups of water. Chicken Broth works too</li>
        <li><strong>Salted Butter</strong>: 2 Tbsp</li>
        <li><strong>All-Purpose Flour</strong>: 1/4 cup of all purpose flour combines with the butter to form a roux that thickens the soup</li>
        <li><strong>Milk</strong>: 2 cups</li>
        <li><strong>Salt and Pepper</strong>: to taste</li>
        <li><strong>Parsley</strong>: 2 Tbsp minced. Optional</li>
    </ul>

    <ol><h3>Steps</h3>
        <li>In the stock pot, add 2 Tbsp olive oil on medium heat. Add the carrots, celery, and onion and cook down until slightly softened and the onions are nice and glossy, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add potatoes, vegetable broth, and ham in the stockpot. Bring the pot to a boil. Once boiling, turn the heat down to medium and let the potatoes simmer for about 15 minutes, or until they are tender. Stir in the pepper.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in a separate medium-size saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk in the all-purpose flour until smooth. Cook for about 1 minute. (Note: this is a “blonde roux” so you don't want the flour to toast too much!) Whisk in milk and cook for about 4 minutes until thick and warm.</li>
        <li>Pour milk/roux mixture into the stockpot with ham soup and whisk to combine. Cook until all vegetables reach desired tenderness and soup thickens to your liking, another 10 minutes should do it. Add the parsley, additional salt and pepper if needed and enjoy!</li>
